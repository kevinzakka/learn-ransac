Learning about the different uses of [RANSAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_sample_consensus): Ransom Sample Consensus.

RANSAC is an iterative method for estimating the parameters of a mathematical model from a set of observed data that contains outliers, when the outliers need to be ignored. It is non-deterministic; the more you let it run, the more reasonable the result.
